# GitPython

## Introduction
GitPython is a Python library used to interact with Git repositories.

For more information check the [official documentation](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython).

This is my own repository where I simply play around with the tool since I've developed an interest in it. Basically at work I have a task I need to complete that involves making the same change in the numerous repositories that myself and my team manages. 
As anyone could imagine going through each repository one by one, branching off from main, making the change, then having to commit and push those changes, over and over in a lot of repositories is a tedious activity. 

So like anyone else would in my position I want to write a script that takes care of all this for me. In my case I'm quite partial to using Python as my language of choice when it comes to writing scripts, I was already aware that I could achieve what I want by making use of other libraries like `os`, `subprocess` for example, but I only came across `GitPython` quite recently so thought I might as well try to make use of something more specific to my case.

__At the time of writing: everything to this point was written directly in GitHub, this repository wasn't initialised locally and hasn't yet been cloned as I intend to do this via GitPython__
